        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crispy pork belly is all the rage, thanks to social media, food 
            bloggers, and celebrity chefs with too much time on their hands. 
            It's a common sight on menus across the land; you can't channel-surf 
            past a food show without seeing it. It also helps that people are 
            no longer terrified to eat a little fat.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound whole pork belly, skin removed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika, or to taste</li>
            <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Season pork belly all over with smoked paprika, salt, and black 
                pepper. Wrap pork in parchment paper; wrap a second time in aluminum 
                foil; wrap a third time in another sheet of aluminum foil. 
                Place pork packet in a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 6 hours. Let 
                cool in wrappings to room temperature; place cooled packet in 
                the refrigerator and chill for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Unwrap chilled pork; reserve any rendered fat that falls away 
                when unwrapping pork.</li>
            <li>Cut pork into 6 equal portions. Cut 1/8x1/8-inch slashes 
                in the fat-side of pork. Season with salt.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons reserved pork fat in a skillet over medium 
                heat. Place pork belly, fat-side down, in hot fat; cook until 
                browned on all sides and heated through, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer pork belly to a plate, drizzle with olive oil, 
                and season with pepper.</li>
        </ol>
